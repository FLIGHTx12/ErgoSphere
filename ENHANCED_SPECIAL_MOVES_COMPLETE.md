### Key Code Changes:

#### Enhanced Special Move Logic:
```javascript
// Jaybers8 healing special move
if (currentPlayer === 'Jaybers8' && playerRoll === 8) {
    damage = 100;
    if (bossHits.Jaybers8 > 0) {
        bossHits.Jaybers8 -= 1;
        gameStats.healsUsed += 1;
        // Play healing sound and show enhanced message
    }
}

// Flight shield special move  
if (currentPlayer === 'Flight' && playerRoll === 12) {
    damage = 100;
    gameStats.shieldsActive += 1;
    // Show enhanced shield message
}
```

#### Multiplayer Damage Bonus:
```javascript
const isMultiplayer = (bossHits.Jaybers8 > 0 || gameStats.healsUsed > 0) && 
                     (bossHits.Flight > 0 || gameStats.shieldsActive > 0);
if (isMultiplayer) {
    damage = Math.floor(damage * 1.2); // 20% bonus
}
```

#### Shield Consumption:
```javascript
// When boss hits players, consume shields first
if (gameStats.shieldsActive > 0) {
    gameStats.shieldsActive -= 1;
    // Block the hit, show shield message
} else {
    // Apply the hit normally
}
```
