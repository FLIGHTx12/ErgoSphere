        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li><b>Handicap:</b> If there is a height advantage, the defensive player is allowed to start behind the first hash from the free-throw line. 📏</li>

        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>The offensive player is allowed to confirm the score before stating it, but if either checking the ball or stating the score is not done or the wrong score is stated, the offensive player forfeits their turn. ❌</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The offensive player can drive for a layup, take a jump shot, or shoot from the 3-point line where they are starting. ⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♂️</li>
      <li>Once the offensive player starts dribbling, the defensive player can leave their position and defend. 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️
        <ul class="rules-list"></ul>
          <li>If the defender leaves their starting spot before the offensive player starts dribbling, the offensive player is allowed a free throw and regains possession. 🏀</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the offensive player makes their shot, they are given a free opportunity at a three-point shot on the opposite side of where they started. 🔄
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>The defender must wait until the offensive player is set before passing them the ball. ⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♂️</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Make It Take It:</b> If the offensive player makes the three-pointer, they get to be on offense again. 🔄</li>
      <li>If the offensive player misses the three-point shot, then the turn is over and the roles switch. 🔁</li>
      <li>In the event of a clear/agreed-upon foul, the offensive player is allowed a free turn. ➕</li>
