# Console Error Fixes for ErgoSphere

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ Missing `css-debug-helper.js` File
**Problem**: The HTML was referencing `../js/css-debug-helper.js` which didn't exist, causing a 404 error.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive CSS debug helper utility with the following features:
- Debug mode activation via URL parameter or localStorage
- Element outline toggling for layout debugging
- Theme information display
- Responsive design checking
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+D) for debug panel
- Utility functions for quick debugging

### 2. ✅ HTML Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Script tags in the HTML head section had malformed formatting.

**Solution**: Fixed script tag formatting and proper spacing between elements.

### 3. ✅ Updated Script References
**Problem**: HTML was still referencing `weekly-tracker-enhancements.js` instead of the cleaned version.

**Solution**: Updated to use `weekly-tracker-enhancements-clean.js` which is the optimized version.

### 4. ✅ Added Script Load Verification
**Problem**: No easy way to verify all scripts loaded correctly.

**Solution**: Created `script-load-verification.js` to:
- Check all required global objects (jQuery, React, ReactDOM)
- Verify key functions are available
- Log comprehensive dependency status
- Help identify any remaining loading issues

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `js/css-debug-helper.js` - CSS debugging utility
- `js/script-load-verification.js` - Script loading verification

### Modified Files:

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All console errors should now be resolved. The page should load without 404 errors and all functionality should work correctly.

## Debug Features Available

With the new CSS debug helper, you can now:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to toggle debug panel
- Use `debugCSS.highlight(selector, color)` to highlight elements
- Use `debugCSS.theme()` to check current theme colors
- Use `debugCSS.responsive()` to check responsive breakpoints
- Use `debugCSS.outlines()` to toggle element outlines

The script load verification will automatically run and log the status of all dependencies in the console.
