While praised for its engaging gameplay, unique character abilities, and accessible nature reminiscent of the \"Hot Shots Golf\" series, some critics noted its last-generation visuals and the inclusion of microtransactions for unlocking gear. Despite this, the game offered a distinct arcade golfing experience on the Xbox One, providing a fun and less simulation-focused alternative to more traditional golf titles. A free version was also available, offering a selection of courses and events, with the option to purchase the full game and additional content such as new courses and characters later on.",

Omeda Studios, founded in 2020 by Robbie Singh, Andrea Garella, and Steven Meilleur, with guidance from Paragon's former creative director Steve Superville, successfully secured funding from Epic Games to bring this vision to life using Unreal Engine 5.\n\nMatches in Predecessor pit two teams of five players against each other on a symmetrical map featuring three lanes, a jungle, and strategically placed defensive towers. The ultimate objective is to destroy the enemy team's core while protecting your own. Players choose from a roster of over 40 unique heroes, each possessing four distinct abilities and a basic attack. As players earn gold and experience during a match by defeating enemies and securing objectives, they can purchase items to customize their hero's build and enhance their abilities, allowing for diverse playstyles and strategic adaptations.\n\nPredecessor entered a buy-to-play early access phase in December 2022 before launching its free-to-play open beta in March 2024, garnering a player base of over two million prior to its full release on PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X|S. While still evolving, Predecessor has been praised by many for its engaging gameplay, faithful recreation of Paragon's core mechanics, and high-quality graphics, aiming to provide both veterans of the original game and newcomers with a fresh and exciting MOBA experience.
