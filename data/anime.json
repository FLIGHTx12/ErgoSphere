They must learn to survive in this new environment, contend with dangerous creatures and natural disasters, and navigate the complexities of human relationships under extreme pressure. Each group comprises seven individuals, selected for their unique skills and potential, and they are guided by cryptic instructions left behind by the project's creators.

The anime adaptation, produced by Gonzo, was released in two parts in 2019 and 2020.
