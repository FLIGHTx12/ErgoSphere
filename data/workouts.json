You won't need any equipment, just some space to move, as Juice & Toya guide you through the routine from their bright, indoor workout area. The format involves 20 different exercises, each performed for 25 seconds, followed by a quick 10-second pause, and then another 25 seconds of a variation on that same exercise before a 20-second rest. Since there are no repeats across the main 20 exercises, you can expect a dynamic workout that keeps things interesting from start to finish. ðŸ”¥",
