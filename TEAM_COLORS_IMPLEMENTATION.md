styleTeamName(league, teamName, isBackground)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Team Data Structure
```json
// Before (simple strings):
"teams": {
  "nfl": ["Minnesota Vikings", "Green Bay Packers", ...]
}

// After (objects with colors):
"teams": {
  "nfl": [
    {"name": "Minnesota Vikings", "primaryColor": "#4F2683", "secondaryColor": "#FFC62F"},
    {"name": "Green Bay Packers", "primaryColor": "#203731", "secondaryColor": "#FFB612"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Color Implementation
- **Primary Color**: Main team color for text styling
- **Secondary Color**: Used for text shadows and gradients
- **Gradient Styling**: Background gradients using both colors for receipt headers
- **Contrast**: White text with dark shadows for readability

## Files Modified
1. `data/casino-data.json` - Updated team data structure
2. `js/casino.js` - Added color functionality and updated team handling
3. `test-team-colors.js` - Created test verification script

## Testing Verification ✅

- Server running successfully on port 3000

## Visual Results
