# Weekly Choices Feature Update - Summary

## Date Format Update for TV Shows
Added improved date formatting for Anime, Sunday Morning Cinema, and Sunday Night shows in the weekly selections system.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Display
1. Updated date formatting to show:
   - Date in MM/DD format (e.g., "06/22")
   - Weeks remaining instead of days (e.g., "3 weeks left")
   - "Ended" status for past dates
   - Special glowing effect when only 1 week remains

### CSS Styling
1. Added animation for the glowing effect when a show has only 1 week left
2. Improved styling for show end dates in both preview and main display

### JS Functions
1. Updated `getShowEndDateString()` in index-specific.js to calculate weeks remaining
2. Added equivalent `formatEndDateForPreview()` in manage-selections.html
3. Fixed element ID detection for different show types

## Testing Tools
1. Added script to verify date formatting with different dates (past, 1 week, 4 weeks)
2. Script also populates database with test shows having different end dates

## How to Verify
1. Check that shows display as "MM/DD - X weeks left"
2. Shows with exactly 1 week left should have a pulsing glow effect
3. Past shows should display "MM/DD - Ended"

## Example
A show ending on June 22nd, 2025 would display: "06/22 - 1 week left" with a glowing effect
